=== Create a RESTful service whose controller layer has three endpoints ===

-Solution is using MongoDB, so you need to install MongoDB in your local.
-Install Node.js latest version.
-Install Angular version 9+.
-Solution is following MVC pattern architecture.

-You need to run the server and the client separatly:
-> To run the server open a terminal and go to 'server' folder location in a terminal:
    example: 'cd coding_challenge_solution_2/server'
    Then run 'npm start'
-> To run client open another terminal and go to client 'app' folder :
    example: 'cd coding_challenge_solution_2/client/code-challenge/src/app'
    Then run 'ng serve'

Once both proyects are running go to the 'localhost:4200' in your browser.
Now it's ready!!
